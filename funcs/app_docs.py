        ### About the Process Flow Documentation
        
        The detailed process flow documentation above illustrates the complete pipeline from input data to final results. 
        It provides a comprehensive view of:
        
        - How SMILES data is processed and augmented
        - How the Hierarchical Generative Model (HGM) is trained
        - The molecule generation process using beam search and sampling
        - How the Bioactivity Prediction Pipeline (BPP) evaluates molecules
        - The analysis and visualization of results
        
        This visualization is particularly useful for understanding the relationships between different components 
        and how data flows through the entire system.
